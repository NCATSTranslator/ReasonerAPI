## A TRAPI Attribute Specification for Source Retrieval Provenance

The Attribute-based approach for representing source retrieval provenance (specified [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/177sOmjTueIK4XKJ0GjxsARg909CaU71tReIehAp5DDo/edit#heading=h.9mu3cpnwwefy)) is now depretated and replaced by a refactored model implemented in TRAPI 1.3. Documentation COMING HERE SOON.
