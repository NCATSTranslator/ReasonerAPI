      description: >-
        The Query class is used to package a user request for information. A
        Query object consists of a required Message object with optional
        additional properties. Additional properties are intended to convey
        implementation-specific or query-independent parameters. For example,
        an additional property specifying a log level could allow a user to
        override the default log level in order to receive more fine-grained
        log information when debugging an issue.

            The query Message is a serialization of the user request. Content
            of the Message object depends on the intended TRAPI operation. For
            example, the fill operation requires a non-empty query_graph field
            as part of the Message, whereas other operations, e.g. overlay,
            require non-empty results and knowledge_graph fields.
