          nullable: true

        constraint_use:
          type: boolean
          description: >-
            Indicates whether this attribute can be used as a query
            constraint.
          default: false
        constraint_name:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Human-readable name or label for the constraint concept.
            Required whenever constraint_use is true.
          example: p-value
          nullable: true
      required:
        - attribute_type_id
    QueryConstraint:
      type: object
      description: >-
        Generic query constraint for a query node or query edge
      properties:
        id:
          allOf:
            - $ref: '#/components/schemas/CURIE'
          description: >-
            CURIE of the concept being constrained. For properties
            defined by the Biolink model this SHOULD be a biolink CURIE.
            otherwise, if possible, from the EDAM ontology. If a suitable
            CURIE does not exist, enter a descriptive phrase here and
            submit the new type for consideration by the appropriate
            authority.
          example: EDAM:data_0844
        name:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Human-readable name or label for the constraint concept.
            If appropriate, it SHOULD be the term name of the CURIE used
            as the 'id'. This is redundant but required for human
            readability.
          example: molecular mass
        not:
          type: boolean
          default: false
        operator:
          type: string
          description: >-
            Relationship between the database value and the constraint value
            for the specified id. The operators ==, >, and < mean
            is exactly equal to, is greater than, and is less than,
            respectively. The 'matches' operator indicates that the value
            is a regular expression to be evaluated. If value is a list type,
            then at least one evaluation must be true (equivalent to OR).
            This means that the == operator with a list acts like a SQL 'IN'
            clause. The 'not' property negates the operator such that not
            and == means 'not equal to' (or 'not in' for a list), and not >
            means <=, and not < means >=, and not matches means does not
            match. The '==' operator SHOULD NOT be used in a manner that
            describes an "is a" subclass relationship for the parent QNode.
          enum:
            - ==
            - '>'
            - <
            - matches
        value:
          example: 57.0
          description: >-
            Value of the attribute. May be any data type, including a list.
            If the value is a list and there are multiple items, at least one
            comparison must be true (equivalent to OR). If 'value' is of data
            type 'object', the keys of the object MAY be treated as a list.
            A 'list' data type paired with the '>' or '<' operators will
            encode extraneous comparisons, but this is permitted as it is in
            SQL and other languages.
        unit_id:
          example: UO:0000222
          description: >-
            CURIE of the units of the value or list of values in the 'value'
            property. The Units of Measurement Ontology (UO) should be used
            if possible. The unit_id MUST be provided for (lists of)
            numerical values that correspond to a quantity that has units.
          nullable: true
        unit_name:
          example: kilodalton
          description: >-
            Term name that is associated with the CURIE of the units
            of the value or list of values in the 'value'
            property. The Units of Measurement Ontology (UO) SHOULD be used
            if possible. This property SHOULD be provided if a unit_id is
            provided. This is redundant but recommended for human readability.
          nullable: true
      required:
        - name
        - id
        - operator
