    Query:
      description: >-
        The Query class is used to package a user request for information. A
        Query object consists of a required Message object with optional
        additional properties. Additional properties are intended to convey
        implementation-specific or query-independent parameters. For example,
        an additional property specifying a log level could allow a user to
        override the default log level in order to receive more fine-grained
        log information when debugging an issue.

          description: >-
            The query Message is a serialization of the user request. Content
            of the Message object depends on the intended TRAPI operation. For
            example, the fill operation requires a non-empty query_graph field
            as part of the Message, whereas other operations, e.g. overlay,
            require non-empty results and knowledge_graph fields.

        knowledge of the response (query graph, knowledge graph, and results).

        The query_graph property contains the query configuration, the results
        property contains any answers that are returned by the service,
        and knowledge_graph property contains lists of edges and nodes in the

        information is not, in general, available to other components.
        In addition to a timestamp and logging level, LogEntry
        includes a string intended to be read by a human, along with
        one of a standardized set of codes describing the condition of
